GameOfNim
=========

Created a normal play Nim game in Java, where two players (one can be the CPU) take turns taking blocks from a heap. Uses ideas from the Sprague-Grundy Theorem to calculate the best number of blocks for the computer to take. When playing against the computer, a player can choose from three modes: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
